# Sales_Data-Analysis-Project
Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn library.

## Background Information:
I have used Python Pandas & Python Seaborn to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

I  start by cleaning the data. Tasks during this section include:

* Drop NaN values from DataFrame
* Removing rows based on a condition
* Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

 In the data exploration section I have explored 4 high level business questions related to the data:
 
 * What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
 * What city sold the most product?
 * What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
 * What products are most often sold together?
